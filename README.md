# Work-Day-Scheduler
Assignment 5

## Description
The task of this assignment was to create a work day schedular powered by jquery where the user could add events to a daily planner and save them to local storage.

The assignment criteria are:
* The current day displayed at the top of the calendar on opening
* Timeblocks for standard business hours
* Color coded timeblocks to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* Being able to enter an event when clicking into a timeblock  
* When the save button for that timeblock is clicked, the text for that event is saved in local storage
* When the page is refreshed the events stay
